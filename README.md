> **Stop guessing how much tax you owe.** GigLedger is a self-hosted finance dashboard built for freelancers, contractors, and gig workers who want a clear picture of income, expenses, and quarterly tax obligations — without the complexity of full accounting software.

## ✨ Why GigLedger?

Freelancers have unique financial challenges that personal finance apps don't solve and accounting software overcomplicates. GigLedger fills that gap with three core questions answered at a glance:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| **How much can I safely spend?** | **Safe to Spend** = Bank Balance − Tax Obligation |
| **What do I owe this quarter?** | **Quarterly Tax Estimator** = Net Income × Tax Rate |
| **How long can I survive?** | **Runway Calculator** = Balance ÷ Avg Monthly Expenses |

No more setting aside random percentages. No more spreadsheet gymnastics. Just clarity.

## 🧠 Core Algorithms

### 1. Safe to Spend
```
Safe Balance = Bank Balance − Total Tax Obligation
```
Your bank balance minus every dollar you already owe in taxes this year. This is the number you can actually spend without getting into trouble.

### 2. Quarterly Tax Estimator
```
Quarterly Net Income = Income − Deductible Expenses
Estimated Tax = max(0, Quarterly Net Income × Tax Rate)
```
Only expenses marked as **tax-deductible** reduce your taxable income. The app calculates this automatically per quarter and shows the real-time impact on every transaction.

### 3. Runway Calculator
```
Runway (months) = Current Balance ÷ Average Monthly Expenses (last 3 months)
```
Tells you how many months you can survive at your current spending rate. Color-coded for instant awareness.
